# Engine LOD architecture

Native LOD for the Bevy runtime. LOD geometry joins `WORLD_LAYER`, so it
appears in the water reflection pass by design (`render.rs`,
`REFLECTION_VIEW_LAYERS`); reflection cost is budgeted, not ignored.

## Tier model

Fixed spatial tiers past the full-detail grid: 4-, 8-, and 16-cell blocks
(`side_cells` 4/8/16, DynDOLOD GEOM-01). Block size, mesh source, distance
policy, and variant stay separate dimensions (ARCH-03). Per-worldspace LOD
origins anchor chunks; floor division rounds toward negative infinity so a
position just west of zero lands in cell -1 (GEOM-02). `worldspaces` needs
new origin columns; it holds only id/editor/parent/flags today.

Selection is tier-based first. Projected-size selection is a later option,
not the initial contract.

## Streaming integration

`plan_cells`/`collect_cells` key on single cells with generation-guarded
stale discard and a default of one commit per frame
(`max_cell_commits_per_frame`, tunable in `EngineConfig`). Chunks get a parallel key space
`(world, tier, anchor)` sharing the same commit budget and epoch handling,
so fast travel cannot strand half-loaded chunks. Unload uses hysteresis:
drop a tier only when the camera leaves tier range plus a margin ring, so
boundary oscillation does not thrash loads.

Handoff: each GLB chunk has a stable source-cell node with separately
hideable terrain and object groups, and compatible material batches beneath
each group. A group hides its LOD only when the matching full cell or nearer
tier has passed scene/dependency validation and
is ready to present; `CellStatus::Resident` alone is insufficient. Phase 2
must settle how a group with mixed-ready or failed near models transitions
without holes or duplicates. Bounds are conservative and include every
emitted component, tested across chunk and world boundaries (GEOM-05/06,
RUN-07).

## Camera, shadows, fog

Camera far is currently `CELL_SIZE * (stream_radius + 2) * 2` (`app.rs`),
32,768 units at the default radius 2. Sun shadow cascades derive from the
same radius. LOD range must be fitted with the far plane and fog; distant
shadow coverage needs its own quality and cost decision. `SkyrimClear` fog
reaches its maximum amount of 0.85 at 53,289 units (`sky.rs`), so it does not
make geometry beyond that distance invisible. See the
[Phase 0 evidence](../../research/lod-phase0-evidence.md).

## Render path

- LOD meshes render with the same GPU preprocessing, indirect draw, and
  HZB path as full geometry; the existing proof bridge (`render.rs`)
  covers them without special cases.
- Billboards get a dedicated material (see `billboard-generation.md`).
- Dynamic proxies are ordinary entities with distance/state systems (see
  `lod-runtime-proxies.md`), spatially bucketed, never full-scene scanned
  per frame (RUN-05).

## Delivery plan

Each phase is planned, not accepted. A green build or completed task list does
not open its dependents; the phase gate needs recorded evidence and review.
The [Phase 0 evidence](../../research/lod-phase0-evidence.md) supplies the
current findings. Skyrim-compatible asset output remains outside this plan.

| Phase | Capability | Depends on | Acceptance gate |
|-------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0 | Approved policies and baseline protocol | None | Remaining handoff failure policy, input/publication mechanics, and measurement protocol resolved; no behavior change |
| 1 | Generation-safe terrain LOD slice | Phase 0 accepted | Two-cell handoff fixture, terrain ring captures, schema/build validation, and measured budgets pass |
| 2 | Eligible static object chunks | Phase 1 accepted | Classification, omission trace, rebuild equivalence, handoff, and per-tier budgets pass |
| 3 | Object-route tree billboards | Phase 2 accepted | Atlas/mip coverage and matched foliage captures pass |
| 4 | Dynamic proxies and glow | Phase 2 accepted | Enable-state, epoch, and approved animation tests pass |
| 5 | Integrated quality and performance proof | Phases 3 and 4 accepted | Repeated target-hardware campaign and signed visual review pass |

Phase 0 settles contracts that would otherwise invalidate the DB and renderer
work in Phase 1. Phase 1 proves generation identity and handoff before objects
multiply the content and state cases. Phase 3 reuses Phase 2's object selection,
provenance, and handoff path. Phase 4 handles references Phase 2 deliberately
omits, but does not depend on Phase 3's atlas. Phase 5 tests their combined cost
and appearance.

### Phase 0: finish the approved contracts

The following policy choices are approved; none is implemented or visually
accepted yet:

- Keep ADR-0010's file-backed GLB and R-tree direction. Use a stable
  source-cell node with separately hideable terrain and object groups,
  batching compatible materials below each group. Identify nodes without
  relying on traversal order. Define terrain/object group readiness and
  failure handoff using a two-cell,
  two-material fixture; a resident root is not enough.
- Publish only while the engine is stopped for v1. Build from an immutable
  input boundary, carry one build identity across DB, manifest, and chunks,
  validate the complete staged set, and preserve the last-good output on
  failure. Live asset replacement is out of scope. Specify how the offline
  boundary is enforced and how interruption/rollback are recovered before
  changing the world DB schema.
- Use a valid `lodsettings/<worldspace>.lod` as the origin source for installed
  worlds. Custom worlds may provide an explicit per-worldspace origin. If
  neither is valid, skip that world's LOD with an actionable error; never
  silently assume zero. Use floor division for negative chunk coordinates.
- Start object compilation with verified, unconditionally enabled fixed
  references, initially a narrow `STAT` class. Extract reference header flags
  and XESP parent/inversion so initially disabled or enable-dependent records
  are omitted with reasons, not baked into static chunks.
- Determine visible range from projected error, camera far, weather, and
  measured cost. Keep distant-shadow coverage independent of camera far;
  measure main and reflection passes separately. Fog's 0.85 cap is not a
  visibility cutoff. Use scripted matched captures and target-hardware
  profiling to set numerical budgets rather than inventing them here.

Gate: document the remaining failure/recovery mechanics, stable node identity,
and measurement protocol; review the two-cell fixture design. No runtime
behavior changes in Phase 0. Phase 1 stays closed until these are accepted.

### Phase 1: prove terrain and shared streaming

Build the offline input/publication contract, versioned chunk metadata and
R-tree, validated GLB payload path, and epoch-safe streaming. Compile a coarse
terrain ring from the cell cache beyond the full-detail unload ring. Preserve
negative-grid anchoring, conservative bounds, and a declared seam/skirt policy.
Handoff must hide only the covered source cell when its full terrain or nearer
tier is drawable, then recover on failed or cancelled loads.

Gate: the two-cell fixture proves independent visibility through load, failure,
unload, teleport, and tier transitions, with no persistent hole or duplicate.
Fresh scripted terrain captures show no unacceptable seams. DB, manifest, and
GLB identity checks reject missing or mixed generations; interrupted builds
leave the last valid output usable. Record matched frame P95/P99, load latency,
memory, primitive count, main/reflection GPU cost where available, and near
shadow quality against the Phase 0 baseline. Do not treat unavailable GPU
counters as zero. Static objects and billboards remain out of scope.

### Phase 2: compile static objects conservatively

Use the authoritative base record type, reference header flags, XESP state,
model behavior, and bounds for eligibility; `statics` is a model catalog, not
an allowlist. Start with verified fixed `STAT` references. Omit unknown,
initially disabled, enable-dependent, movable, animated, and unresolved
large-reference cases with a recorded reason until their later route exists.
Preserve authored LOD shape metadata before using those NIF blocks as tier
sources. Compile compatible material batches within the Phase 0 visibility
unit, and retain provenance and a missing-reference inspector.

Gate: representative state, movement, large-reference, negative-grid, and
boundary fixtures show no baked stale object or lasting overlap. Partial and
clean builds from identical inputs are semantically equal; source moves
invalidate every affected tier. Record per-tier/category geometry, texture,
draw, memory, and main/reflection pass costs. Unsupported dynamics stay
omitted; Phase 4 owns their proxy route.

### Phase 3: add tree billboards

Compile object-route tree billboards and a bounded per-worldspace atlas; test
tilt/fall transforms, alpha and mip coverage, and atlas invalidation. Keep
unsupported grass LOD and Skyrim `.LST`/`.BTT` output deferred. Gate: scripted
matched near/far foliage captures retain the accepted palette (ADR-0009),
while atlas, overdraw, memory, and frame budgets hold on target hardware.

### Phase 4: add dynamic proxies

Implement state-following individual proxies for an approved set of enable
parents, glow/window overlays, and animations. Keep scripts, collision, AI,
inventory, and unapproved movement in the full runtime. Gate: both XESP
inversion states, parent errors/cycles, load/fast-travel epochs, save/reload,
and full/proxy handoff pass without stale visuals or duplicated gameplay
effects. Phase 3 foliage is not a prerequisite for this independent route.

### Phase 5: prove the combined result

Run matched, repeated target-hardware campaigns for near-field baseline,
terrain only, static objects, trees, and dynamic effects. Retain raw captures,
camera paths, settings, hardware/build IDs, profiler bundles, and per-tier
quality/performance comparisons. Gate: declared budgets and visual tolerances
pass, handoff sequences have no persistent holes or duplicates, and a signed
review accepts fresh scripted vista captures. No visual-readiness claim rests
on CI alone.
